STEP 1: Click on the FIRST "Open" button in the table.

Once on the student detail page, we'll navigate directly to the needs form using the extracted student ID.

Expected flow:
1. On /students - click Open → Navigate to /students/{id}
2. Extract ID from URL
3. Navigate directly to /students/{id}/needs/new (workaround for Angular router link issue)
4. Fill form
5. Submit
6. Check for success (?added=1)
