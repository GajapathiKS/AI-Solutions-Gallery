Scenario: Enroll a new student using the web portal (headed execution only)

- Start the browser in a visible window so I can watch the steps.
- Open the Special Programs portal, sign in with the staff credentials (admin / ChangeMe123!), and navigate to the Students workspace.
- Wait until the "Students" card, the onboarding form, and the "Add Student" button are all visible.
- Use the form to add a learner with a unique local ID, first name, last name, date of birth, grade level, campus, guardian contact, program focus, and enrollment date. Use any review date you like in the future.
- Submit the form and wait until the new student appears in the Active Students table.
- Open the newly created student record from the table.
- On the student overview page, confirm the heading shows the student name and that the Local ID and Program Focus fields display the information you entered.
- Capture a screenshot of the student overview page before finishing.
